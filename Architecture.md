**Top GitOps Tools**
The video covers some of the popular GitOps tools available, including:

1. **Argo CD**: A declarative GitOps-based continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes.
2. **Flux**: A tool for automatically applying the state of a Git repository to a Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Jenkins X**: A CI/CD platform built for Kubernetes that incorporates GitOps principles.
4. **Tekton**: A Kubernetes-native, open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems.
5. **GitLab CI/CD**: GitLab's built-in CI/CD platform that supports GitOps workflows.

Each of these tools has its own strengths and features, but the focus of the video is on Argo CD, which is one of the most widely used GitOps tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

**Architecture of Argo CD**
Argo CD's architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **API Server**: The central component that handles all user and system interactions with Argo CD.
2. **Repository Server**: Responsible for connecting to and monitoring Git repositories, as well as parsing the application manifests.
3. **Application Controller**: Continuously compares the desired state (from Git) with the live state (in the Kubernetes cluster) and reconciles any differences.
4. **Dex**: An identity provider that handles user authentication and authorization for Argo CD.
5. **Redis**: used for- <br />
   Caching: because let's say for some reason this application controller went down now once it comes up it need to have information of what has happened or
   what is the information till now on the cluster so that's why this application controller is a stateful set and this redis is used for caching the information.<br />
   Session Management: Manages user sessions to ensure smooth interaction with the Argo CD dashboard.<br />
   Rate Limiting: Controls the number of API requests to protect the system from overload.<br />
   Task Queues: Helps distribute and manage tasks efficiently.<br />
6. **Kube API Server**: The Kubernetes API server that Argo CD interacts with to deploy and manage applications.

These components work together to implement the GitOps workflow using Argo CD. For example:

1. Argo CD monitors the Git repository for any changes to the application manifests.
2. When a change is detected, the Application Controller compares the desired state (from Git) with the live state (in the Kubernetes cluster).
3. If there are any differences, the Application Controller reconciles them by applying the necessary changes to the cluster.
4. Argo CD also provides features like automated rollbacks, health monitoring, and fast application deployment.

Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the top GitOps tools and the architectural details of Argo CD, which is one of the leading GitOps solutions for Kubernetes.
